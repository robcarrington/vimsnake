# Vimsnake

Vimsnake is a simple game for practicing your Vim directional skills, written in Elm. It works just like the game of Snake you played on your old phone, where you try to eat the food without running into walls or yourself. The only difference is that the directional arrows are mapped as follows:

Left: h
Down: j
Up: k
Right: l
